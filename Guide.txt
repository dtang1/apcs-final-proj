*********************************************************************

The Alpha Wolves focused on mimicking Wolfram Alpha's ability to look 
at and evaluate a single line of text supplied by the user. Our project 
takes the inputed text and turns it into a string. This string is then 
evaluated and is delegated to another class. An appropriate answer is 
then returned. This process takes into account the various ways an 
expression can be expressed. Keep in mind, this project evaluates only 
mathematical expressions and will return "Invalid Input" if no 
operations can be performed. 

Functions Include:
Arithmetic Operaitons following PEMDAS
Finding the roots of a polynomial
Graphing polynomials
Solving linear equations
